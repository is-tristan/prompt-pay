    "quote": "As both an implantologist and a practice owner, the ability to receive next-day payments and reduce our payment processing fees has been a game-changer for us. With high operating costs in our field, the savings offered by Prompt Pay Capital have had a real impact on our bottom line. Alex handled the terminal setup smoothly and provided hands-on support to our receptionist, Claudia, ensuring everything integrates seamlessly with our accounting system. I've already recommended Prompt Pay Capital to several colleagues in the dental and medical field",

The compact size is a real advantage for us, fitting neatly into our limited counter space without disrupting service. The setup was quick and effortless, with Alex ensuring everything worked smoothly and that our staff felt confident using it. Transactions are now faster, and the system integrates perfectly with our daily operations. I'd highly recommend Alex and the team to any café or small business looking for a reliable, space-saving payment solution.",
